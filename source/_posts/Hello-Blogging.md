My first post about who I am and why I started blogging.
<!-- excerpt -->
I hope you understood the “Hello, World!” reference. If not, “Hello, World!” is often the first program programmers write when they try out a new programming language. It only seemed fitting to name my first blogpost with the traditional “Hello, World!” program in mind.

## Who am I?
My name is Daniyar Talipov, I am a programmer from Belgium and IT is my passion. For as long as I can remember I was always surrounded by technology. This eventually led to me getting a bachelor’s degree in Applied Computer Science from [Odisee Brussels](http://www.odisee.be/en) and landing a job as a .NET Software Engineer at [RealDolmen](http://www.realdolmen.com/).

I am currently working for the Belgian Department of Home Affairs on different applications. In my free time I read books about programming, work on side projects and (still) play video games.

## Why blogging?
I'm a guy that likes to share information and knowledge, especially if it’s helpful to someone. I don't consider myself a guru (yet), however I did notice having a passion and drive to learn new things. This often leads to sleepless weekends, but more often it leads to knowledge.  It only seemed fair, after all these years reading blogs to give back some of that acquired knowledge back to the community through the power of the internet!

## Why Soviet Waffle?
After living most of my life in Belgium I consider myself a real Belgian, that's where the Waffle plays its part. However I wasn't born in Belgium, I was born in Kazakhstan (once a part of the Soviet Union). Combining those two milestones in my life, gave birth to **Soviet Waffle**.
